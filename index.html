                <summary>Is this a subscription service?</summary>
                <p>Yes, Hello Chef operates as a subscription service—but it's designed with maximum flexibility in mind:
                    <br>
                    No long-term commitment: We're confident you'll love the quality and value Hello Chef offers. But if it's not for you, you can cancel your subscription at any time, free of charge.
                    <br>
                    Skip weeks anytime: Not cooking this week? No problem. You can skip a delivery for any week—or up to 4 weeks in advance—directly from your account.
                    <br>
                    Manage your plan easily: Adjust your delivery day, change your box size, skip weeks, or even pause your subscription if you need a longer break—all in just a few clicks from your account settings.
                    <br>
                    Auto-renewal: As part of the subscription, your order renews weekly unless you make changes before the cutoff time—11:59 PM GST, 4 days before your delivery day.
                    <br>
                    This flexible approach gives you full control over your meal planning—without locking you into a contract.</p>
